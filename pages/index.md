I wanted to be able to play crossword, scramble, and other word games with
friends in real-time, even if they're a world away or just on the other side of
town.  Like solving a puzzle at the kitchen table with a loved one.

There are some great mobile apps and web sites for playing these puzzles
alone (I even helped make one for a Doodle of the crossword's 100th anniversary)
but they were missing this one feature.

Come back soon!  I am working on this and some other web games.
